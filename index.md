**Scrap & Trace**, created by a group of students from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, is an app that aims to incorporate the use of augmented reality (AR) in the creation of 'scrapbooks', collections of memories that can be shared with others. The app is designed to be used by anyone, and is intended to be a fun and easy way to create and share memories with others. The app is currently in development, written in Kotlin for Android devices.
